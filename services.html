          <h3>Standard Distance Reiki</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="service-intro">
          A nurturing, grounding session that supports emotional ease, energetic clarity,
          and overall balance. Perfect for releasing stress, softening tension, and
          coming back to center.
        </p>

        <p class="service-how">
          <strong>How it works at a distance:</strong>
          Your energy is tuned into remotely through intention and Reiki connection.
          As the session flows, energy is directed to areas that feel heavy, blocked,
          or depleted. You simply rest in a quiet, comfortable space while the healing
          is carried out for you.
        </p>

          <h3>Crystal-Enhanced Distance Reiki</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="service-intro">
          A deeper, more targeted healing experience combining Reiki with the
          amplified support of crystals. Beautiful for emotional release, chakra
          alignment, and intuitive connection.
        </p>

        <p class="service-how">
          <strong>How it works at a distance:</strong>
          Crystals are placed in a specific grid or layout that corresponds to your
          energy field. Reiki is then channeled through this crystal arrangement.
          Even at a distance, crystal vibration interacts with your energy through
          focused intention and the universal flow of Reiki.
