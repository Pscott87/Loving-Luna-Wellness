    <h2>About Loving Luna Wellness</h2>
    <p>
      Loving Luna Wellness is a sanctuary dedicated to gentle energetic healing inspired by
      the intuitive, calming rhythms of the moon. Rooted in Reiki principles and aligned with
      lunar balance, each session is crafted to support peace, grounding, and renewal.
    </p>

    <p>
      My practice blends traditional energy work with a serene, moon-centered approach—
      encouraging clients to reconnect with their inner stillness. Whether you seek emotional
      clarity, energetic realignment, or a moment of deep rest, my intention is to guide you
      toward gentle restoration.
