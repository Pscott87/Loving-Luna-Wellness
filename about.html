    <h2>About Loving Luna Wellness</h2>
    <p>
      Loving Luna Wellness was created as a sanctuary for anyone seeking emotional balance,
      spiritual support, and gentle energetic healing. Rooted in the calming symbolism of the
      moon, this practice offers a soft, nurturing approach to well-being — inviting you back
      into alignment with your own natural rhythm.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through the practice of distance Reiki, your energy is supported no matter where you
      are physically. Sessions are guided intuitively and with compassion, helping you release
      tension, restore clarity, and reconnect to your inner peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a space where you can breathe, reset, and feel held.
