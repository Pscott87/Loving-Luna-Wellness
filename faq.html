  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <p class="faq-intro">
    Here are some common questions about distance Reiki, session types, and what to expect
    before and after your session.
  </p>

  <div class="faq-list">
    <!-- What is Distance Reiki -->
    <details class="faq-item" open>
      <summary>✨ What is distance Reiki and how does it work?</summary>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          Distance Reiki is a method of energy healing where Reiki is sent to you without
          needing to be physically present. Energy is not restricted by space — intention
          and connection allow Reiki to reach you wherever you are. During your session,
          you may rest quietly or simply go about your day. Your practitioner tunes into
          your energy field remotely and channels Reiki where it is most needed.

    <!-- Difference Between Standard and Crystal -->
    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>🌿 What is the difference between Standard Distance Reiki and Crystal-Enhanced Distance Reiki?</summary>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          <strong>Standard Distance Reiki</strong> is grounding and calming, supporting emotional
          balance, clarity, and energetic flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Crystal-Enhanced Distance Reiki</strong> adds crystals to amplify healing,
          supporting deeper emotional release, chakra alignment, and intuitive insight.
          Both are powerful — choose the one you feel intuitively drawn to.
        </p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <!-- Session lengths -->
    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>⏱ What are the differences between the 15, 30, and 45 minute sessions?</summary>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          <strong>15-Min Refresh:</strong> A quick reset to ground, clear mental clutter, and
          restore calm.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>30-Min Standard:</strong> A full, balanced Reiki treatment for emotional
          clarity and energetic flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>45-Min Deep:</strong> A more immersive experience allowing for deeper
          clearing and extended integration.
        </p>
        <p>
          All lengths are effective — longer sessions simply allow more time for deeper work.
        </p>

    <!-- What will I feel? -->
    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>🌙 What will I feel during a distance Reiki session?</summary>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          Every experience is unique. Many clients feel warmth, tingling, emotional release,
          deep relaxation, or a sense of clarity and lightness. Some feel subtle shifts,
          while others experience strong sensations — all are valid.
        </p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <!-- Preparation -->
    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>📍 Do I need to do anything to prepare for my session?</summary>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          Preparation is simple: choose a comfortable, quiet place to sit or lie down, wear
          comfortable clothing, and silence notifications if possible. Setting an intention
          is optional. You don’t need any special tools to receive Reiki.
        </p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <!-- Aftercare -->
    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>💜 What should I do after my session?</summary>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          Drink water, rest if needed, spend time in calm surroundings, and consider
          journaling any insights. Energy continues integrating for hours — sometimes
          days — after the session.
        </p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <!-- Distance vs In-Person -->
    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>🌕 Does distance Reiki work as well as in-person Reiki?</summary>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          Yes — distance Reiki is just as effective as in-person healing. Energy is not
          limited by physical space. Many clients even prefer distance sessions because
          they remain comfortable at home and feel more relaxed during integration.
        </p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <!-- Intentions (updated wording) -->
    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>🌸 Can I request a specific intention or focus area?</summary>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          Absolutely. You may request intentions such as emotional healing, stress reduction,
          heart-centered healing, chakra balancing, intuition support, energetic clearing,
          or general wellness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your practitioner can set an intention or focus area, but it’s important to know
          that <strong>Reiki energy is intelligent and always flows to where it is needed
          most — even if that differs from the intention you set.</strong> The intention
          helps support the direction of the session, while the energy itself knows exactly
          where to go for your highest good.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're unsure, your practitioner will intuitively tune into your energy and
          allow the session to unfold naturally.

    <!-- Busy or moving -->
    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>💬 Can I receive distance Reiki if I'm busy or moving around?</summary>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          Yes — Reiki will still reach you. For the best experience, being still and
          comfortable is recommended, but it is not required.
        </p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <!-- Frequency -->
    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>💫 How often should I receive Reiki?</summary>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          Many clients choose weekly refresh sessions, biweekly 30-minute sessions, or
          monthly deep sessions. The ideal schedule depends on your emotional, spiritual,
          and energetic needs.
